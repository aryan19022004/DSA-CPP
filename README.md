# DSA-CPP

Welcome to the DSA-CPP repository! This repository is dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through comprehensive problem-solving approaches.

## Overview

In this repository, we will go through DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) questions following a structured progression:

### Learning Approach: Brute Force → Better → Optimal

Each problem is solved using multiple approaches, starting from:
- **Brute Force**: The most straightforward solution
- **Better**: An improved solution with better efficiency
- **Optimal**: The most efficient solution possible

## Key Features

✅ **Commented Time Complexity** - Every solution includes detailed time complexity analysis in the code comments

✅ **Commented Space Complexity** - Every solution includes detailed space complexity analysis in the code comments

✅ **Explained Logic** - Clear and detailed explanations of the logic behind each approach to help you understand the thought process

## How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate through the problem folders
2. Read the problem statement
3. Study the solutions from brute force to optimal approaches
4. Pay attention to the time and space complexity comments
5. Understand the logic and reasoning behind each approach
